It involves randomly setting a fraction of the output values of neurons to zero during the forward pass of each training iteration. Dropout acts as a form of model averaging and reduces the reliance on specific neurons, forcing the network to learn more robust and generalizable representations. During testing or inference, dropout is typically turned off, and the output values are scaled to account for the reduced number of active neurons during training."

    "Feature importance in decision trees measures the relative importance or relevance of each feature in the prediction process. It quantifies how much each feature contributes to the decision-making process of the tree. Feature importance can be determined based on different criteria, such as the total reduction in impurity achieved by splits involving the feature or the total information gain associated with the feature. Feature importance helps in understanding the contribution of each feature to the overall predictive power of the decision tree."
